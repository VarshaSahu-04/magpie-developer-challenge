## Magpie PHP Developer Challenge

I gathered data about the products listed on https://www.magpiehq.com/developer-challenge/smartphones

The final output of my script is an array of objects similar to the example below:

```
{
    "title": "iPhone 11 Pro 64GB",
    "price": 123.45,
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.png",
    "capacityMB": 64000,
    "colour": "red",
    "availabilityText": "In Stock",
    "isAvailable": true,
    "shippingText": "Delivered from 25th March",
    "shippingDate": "2021-03-25"
}

```

I have used same repository given by client as a starter template.

Result is created in `output.json`.

### Notes as per bellow instaructions
* De-duplication: Ensured that the client does not see the same product multiple times, even if itâ€™s listed more than once on the website. Products are differentiated by title, price, color, and capacity.
* Variant Capture: All product variants are captured, with each color variant treated as a separate product.
* Capacity in MB: Device capacity is recorded in megabytes (MB) for all products.
* Pagination: The scraper handles pagination to capture all product pages.
* Testing: Utilized PHPUnit to run test cases, ensuring the reliability of the code



### Requirements

* PHP 7.4+
* Composer

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/VarshaSahu-04/magpie-developer-challenge.git
